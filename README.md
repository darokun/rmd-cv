## RMarkdown CV Template

This is an `RMarkdown` CV template created by Daloha Rodríguez Molina following the example set by [Lucy D'Agostino McGowan](https://github.com/LucyMcGowan/rmd-cv) based on the LaTex [Friggeri](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/friggeri-resume-cv) template. It was inspired by a conversation with [Maëlle](https://twitter.com/ma_salmon) as well as [bomeara](https://github.com/bomeara/cv) & [ryanpeek's](https://github.com/ryanpeek/markdown_cv) markdown CVs.
